# Weather-finder
The weather finder is a device that lets you see what the weather will be like in any city on the planet. It uses the open weather API to gather the temperature, humidity, and windspeed of the whatever city you can think of. It also looks five days into the future and will find the temperature and humidity of your selected city.

# Motivation
My Motivation on building this was to learn how to use APIs. My goal was to be able to call an API and have the proper syntax available when I want to display the information I recieved from the API.

# Technologies used
